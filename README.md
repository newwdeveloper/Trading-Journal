Stock Trading Dashboard
This project is a dynamic and interactive stock trading dashboard that allows users to track and manage their stock portfolio. The application enables users to view details about their stocks, such as stock name, buy date, quantity, buy price, total value, and the reason for purchasing the stock.

Key Features:
Stock List: Users can view a list of all the stocks in their portfolio with key information such as stock name and buy date.
Detailed View: Users can click on any stock in the list to navigate to a detailed page showing comprehensive information about that stock, including quantity, buy price, total value, and the reason for buying it.
State Management: The project uses Redux to manage the state of the stock data, making it easy to update and access data across different components of the application.
Routing: React Router is used for seamless navigation between pages, with the stock details passed as state when navigating to the detailed view page.
Responsive Design: The app is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a smooth experience across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
Interactive UI: The application has a clean and modern UI built with Tailwind CSS, providing intuitive and easy navigation for the users.
Technologies Used:
React: The front-end is built using React, allowing for a dynamic and component-based structure.
React Router: For handling navigation and routing between different pages within the app.
Redux: Used for managing and storing stock data centrally.
Tailwind CSS: For styling and creating a responsive, customizable design.
JavaScript (ES6+): For writing clean and modern JavaScript code that powers the appâ€™s functionality.
How It Works:
The stock data is fetched and stored in the Redux state, allowing the user to view a list of all the stocks.
When a user clicks on a stock in the list, they are navigated to a detailed page where more information about the stock is displayed.
The stock details are passed to the DetailedTrade page via the navigation state.
The app is fully responsive, ensuring that it works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
